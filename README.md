# 👋 Hi, I’m Salman Shah

🎓 **Student Researcher | Human–AI Teams | Deep Reinforcement Learning | Digital Twins | Computer Vision**

I’m an student researcher exploring how **AI systems learn, adapt, and collaborate with humans** in complex, uncertain environments.
I investigate how intelligent systems learn, adapt, and collaborate with humans in complex, real-world environments. My work integrates **Deep Learning**, **Reinforcement Learning**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and **Digital Twin simulations** to design adaptive, explainable, and scalable AI systems.

## 🔬 Research Focus

- **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL):** Decision-making under uncertainty and delayed rewards  
- **Digital Twins & XR Simulations:** Real-time integration of virtual and physical systems (Unity, HoloLens 2)  
- **Computer Vision:** Object detection, segmentation, and non-destructive defect analysis (CNNs, Vision Transformers)  
- **Human–AI Collaboration:** Trust, explainability, and adaptive teaming with autonomous systems  
- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Reasoning, instruction-following, and multimodal integration with control systems
